# abstracts-operator
Baby steps for doing abstractions in Haskell

## Overview
Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods. 

## Requirements
- [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) version >= 2.5
- [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck)
- [test-framework](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/test-framework-0.8.2.0/docs/Test-Framework.html)

## Implements
- [Haskell](https://github.com/natserract/abstract-operator/blob/master/src/Abstracts.hs)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/natserract/abstract-operator/blob/master/compile.ts)

## Run
```sh
stack run
```

## Test
```sh
stack test
```
